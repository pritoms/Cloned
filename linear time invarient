linear time invarient function:
 - dynamics do not depend on specific external time
 - function at one time is equivalent to another
 - objects affect via linear change in motion
 - impulse causes proportional change
 - superposition principle holds

linerity:
 - response to sum of two impulses is same as the sum of responses to individual impulse signal

honogeneity:
 - scaling input is equal to scaling output by same factor

time invarience:
 - shifting input of function x(t) by h will cause shift in output of function y(t) by g where h = g

impulse-response:
 - if h(t) is the response for unit impulse delta(t) -- for arbitrary input, the output is the convolution of impulse response with the input signal.
